# mineflayer-terminator-bot
A node.js Minecraft bot for terminating players.
This project uses mineflayer to connect to a server and attempt to kill players of your choice. The bot will automatically manage any armor, weapons or food given to it.

Note: This may or may not work as intended for now, as the is code is currently being simplified and cleaned up.
