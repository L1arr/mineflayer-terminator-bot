# mineflayer-terminator-bot
A node.js Minecraft bot for terminating players.
This project uses mineflayer to connect to a server and attempt to kill players you target. You can give the bot weapons, food and armor and it will manage and use these resources automatically.

Note: This may or may not work as intended anymore, and is currently undergoing some changes to the code.
